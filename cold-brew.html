	<h1>Cold Brew</h1>
	<h2>A summertime favorite...</h2>
	<p>I distinctly remember my first cold brew coffee (with coconut milk, of course). I was sitting in the sun at Pannikin after a long run with friends. Nothing had ever tasted so delicious.</p> 
	<h2>How it's made</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Grind 3/4 cup of beans <em>very coarsely</em> per 4 cups of water</li>
		<li>Soak the coarse-ground beans in room temperature (or cold) water for a very long time, usually 12 hours or more</li>
		<li>Filter the grounds out of the water using a paper coffee filter, a fine metal sieve, a French press or felt</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Exciting enhancements</h2>
