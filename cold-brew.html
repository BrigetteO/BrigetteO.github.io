	<h1>Cold Brew</h1>
	<h2>A summertime favorite</h2>
	<p class="main">I distinctly remember my first cold brew coffee (with coconut milk, of course). I was sitting in the sun at Pannikin after a long run with friends. Nothing had ever tasted so delicious.</p> 
	<br>
	<h2>How it's made</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Grind 3/4 cup of beans <em>very coarsely</em> per 4 cups of water</li>
		<li>Soak the coarse-ground beans in room temperature (or cold) water for 12 hours or more</li>
		<li>Filter the grounds out of the water using a paper coffee filter, fine metal sieve, French press etc.</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<h2>Exciting enhancements</h2>

		<h3>Cold brew + Nitro!</h3>
		<p>A sweeter and creamier version of the original can be made by adding nitrogen, which is typically stored in a pressurized keg and poured from a tap.</p>

		<h3>Cold brew + Horchata!</h3>
		<p>Possibly one of the most ingenious combinations to date, it's only a matter of time before this delightful beverage gains a cult following.</p>
