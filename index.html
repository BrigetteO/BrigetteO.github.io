	<h2>In the Beginning</h2>
		<p>Coffee makes world go round. The earliest evidence of human caffeine dependency dates back to the Sufi monasteries of Yemen in the 15th century. Yemeni traders brought Ethiopian coffee back to their homeland and began to cultivate the bean. Sufis in Yemen used the beverage to aid concentration when chanting the name of their God and to keep alert during their nighttime devotions.</p>
	<h2>Modern Times (not the brewery)</h2>
		<p>Since then, the coffee offering has diversified greatly. My favorite addition to the coffee family is <strong><a href="cold-brew.html">cold brew</a></strong>, which I drink with a religious intensity (not unlike the Sufis).</p>
		<p>For those who share my enthusiasm for this particular beverage, you may find this guide on <strong><a href="http://guysbiteout.com/best-cold-brew-coffee-san-diego/">San Diego's best cold brew</a></strong> to be a helpful resource. Some elements of this website I admire are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The images all look Pinterest-worthy and are well integrated (similar sizing and consistent width).</li>
				<li>The formatting of the list, specifically the different font types used, make the page aesthetically pleasing and easy to follow / well organized.</li>
				<li>The website tab includes miniature fork and knife images, which is really cool.</li>
			</ul>
