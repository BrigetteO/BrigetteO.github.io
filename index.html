	<h1>The History of Coffee</h1>
	<h2>In the Beginning</h2>
		<p>Coffee makes world go round. The earliest evidence of human caffeine dependency dates back to the Sufi monasteries of Yemen in the 15th century. Yemeni traders brought Ethiopian coffee back to their homeland and began to cultivate the bean. Sufis in Yemen used the beverage to aid concentration when chanting the name of God and to keep alert during their nighttime devotions.</p>
	<h2>Modern Times (not the brewery)</h2>
		<p>Since then, the coffee offering has diversified greatly. Two of my favorite additions to the coffee family are cold brew and nitro (both of which are now available at Starbucks, which I have conflicting feelings about.)</p>
